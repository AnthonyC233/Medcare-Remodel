## Medcare-Healthcert-Remodel

## Description
A reformatted, newly-fashioned and modernist website for <i>MedCare HealthCert</i>, a medical school stationed in Lawrenceville, GA which offers clinical training and certifications in Phlebotomy, Medical Assistant (CCMA), Patient Care Technician (PCT), EKG Technician, Medical Insurance, Billing and Coding (MIBC), Certified Medical Administrative Assistant (CMAA), and Certified Electronic Health Record Specialist (CEHRS).

This version provides an advanced and more creative approach to UX/UI than that of its precursor. Utilizing technologies like React allowed for greater control of separating component concerns, and was a proven asset when employing AOS, Owl, Tailwind, and React Helmet to name a few. Despite the given wireframe, our Team's demonstration of ingenuity allowed for newer heights to be achieved, and a more finalized version of the site; despite some moderate setbacks in regards to the general agile methodology. Overall, the IA and visual heirarchy became more throughgoing throughout testing and stand-ups, and the Team's communication pulled through during the climax of development.
